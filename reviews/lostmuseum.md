# Review of The Lost Museum (http://lostmuseum.cuny.edu/)
## by Myrna and Elizabeth


## What does the URL tell you?
A City University of New York sponsored project 

## What's the Subject Matter?
Discusses the Barnum Museum in the 19th century and exhibits contained within it.

## Is it trustworthy?
Yes, published by university and all of the sources are extensively documented. Can see a big team of historians were involved with its creation. The content is obviously intended as a learning tool.

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?
For someone who was casually interested might be a good jumping point and have the game to get you engaged. Has different levels the game and the archive. Nothing is necessarily lost by non-linear since you have topics going in so many directions.

## Overall, would you recommend this site to someone interested in the subject matter? To a researcher? 
We would recommend to a high school level enviroment or someone casually interested, but not necessarily a researched for the interactive compotent. The archive might be of more use to a researcher.
